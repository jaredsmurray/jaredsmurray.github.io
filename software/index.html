      <p>bfa is an R package for fitting Bayesian factor models (Gaussian, probit, mixed and semiparametric copula models) under a range of priors for the factor loadings. These include continuous and spike-and-slab shrinkage priors. MCMC is performed in compiled code, so model fitting is typically quite fast.

<p>Here you can find the MPTuner software, an implementation of adaptive median polish algorithms for anomaly detection in sensor networks. The algorithms were developed by Prof. Ernst Linder at the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.math.unh.edu/">University of New Hampshire&#8217;s Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a></span> as part of the 2007 SAMSI program on Environmental Sensor Networks. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.mbl.edu/ecosystems/staff/cardon/">Dr. Zoe Cardon</a></span> at Woods Hole provided us with test data and insight into the ecological processes involved. I wrote the software during my senior year under the mentorship of Prof. Linder. For background on the technique you may refer to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.samsi.info/content/median-polish-algorithms-automated-data-cleaning">this talk</a></span> by Prof. Linder.<br />
The software is available as the original Python source or as a Windows executable. The scripts should run anywhere that Python and wxPython do. The binary is for Windows platforms only and has been tested in XP, Vista and Windows 7.</p>
<h4>Installation:</h4>
<p>Windows binary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package</a></span> is installed.</li>
<li>Download and extract <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://stat.duke.edu/~jsm38/resources/mpt-winbin.zip" rel="self">mpt-winbin.zip</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>From source:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPTuner is a Python application. It has several dependencies which are listed below. It has been tested on these versions, but it should work on more recent versions as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python 2.6.2</a></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy 1.3</a></span></li>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython 2.8.10.1</a></span> (Unicode)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib 0.98.5.3</a></span></li>

</ul>
<h4>Running:</h4>
<ul>
<li>(optional) Edit the config.txt file as desired.</li>
<li>Run &#8220;gui_app.exe&#8221; if you are using the Windows binary, or execute the &#8220;gui_app.py&#8221; script. At the command line you can specify a datafile to load with the &#8220;-d&#8221; flag (e.g.: python gui_app.py -d &#8220;datafile.csv&#8221;).</li>
<li>Load the data (File &gt; Load data).</li>
<li>(optional) Assign names to the factors identified in the data file (Data &gt; Show data import settings). You can save the factor definitions file once finished.</li>
<li>(optional) Select factors to group the data by, e.g, treatments (Data &gt; Show group settings).</li>
<li>The &#8220;Group&#8221; dropdown list will be populated with the nonempty groups. Select one, adjust the tuning parameters and push &#8220;Recalculate&#8221;. After running the polish for the various groups you can save the cleaned data (File &gt; Save data).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues:</h4>
<ul>
<li>I wrote MPTuner as an undergraduate project. I didn&#8217;t know any Python when I started; I was learning as I went. It shows in the code (although it’s fully functional!).</li>
<li>MPTuner uses the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://xoomer.virgilio.it/infinity77/main/freeware.html">EnhancedStatusBar</a></span> class graciously provided by Andrea Gavana. This provides the colored square when you click on a line in the plot window. On some platforms the colored square doesn&#8217;t appear.</li>
<li>On (re)calcuating the median polish, you may see a DeprecationWarning indicating that scipy.stats.median is deprecated in favor of numpy.median. At present this doesn&#8217;t impact the functioning of MPTuner. This is an issue in the nanmedian function in SciPy using its own median function when it should be using NumPy&#8217;s. My understanding is that the change has been made in newer versions of SciPy.</li>
