	I'm an assistant professor of statistics in the Department of Information, Risk, and Operations Management at the MccCombs School of Business. Until July of 2017 I was a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. 
	I recently completed my Ph.D. in Statistical Science at Duke University with Jerry Reiter. 
	I also hold a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Mathematics (Statistics) from the University of New Hampshire and an M.S. in Statistical Science from Duke University.

My research focuses on non- and semiparametric Bayesian models for heterogeneous, structured multivariate data. 
It is driven primarily by interdisciplinary projects in public policy and the social sciences, including multiple imputation
for missing data problems, latent variable modeling, and causal inference, although the methods I develop are applicable in a 
broad range of settings.
